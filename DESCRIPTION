Description: Implements multiple change searching algorithms for a variety of 
    frequently considered parametric change-point models. In particular, it 
    integrates a criterion proposed by Zou, Wang and Li (2020) 
    <doi:10.1214/19-AOS1814> to select the number of change-points in a 
    data-driven fashion. Moreover, it also provides interfaces for 
    user-customized change-point models with one's own cost function and 
    parameter estimation routine. It is easy to get started with the 
    cpss.* set of functions by accessing their documentation pages 
    (e.g., ?cpss).
